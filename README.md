# Hello-World
*Just trying things outâ€¦*

At the moment (Saturday March 19, 2022) I am an absolute beginner to Git and GitHub, having only used Git to clone other people's main branches (in order to compile the code / install the program) before.

I am also new to programming, with a very basic command of C and a less-than-basic command of Python.

With creating this account, I hope to both improve my skills at using Git and GitHub in the short term, and to improve my programming skills in the long run.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
  {
    print("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
  }
